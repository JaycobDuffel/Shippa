=========

## Project Overview
Shippa is an app that acts as the middleman between car dealers and carriers. 
Shippa Allows car dealers to post shipments on a map 
for carriers to see. Carriers can then click the shipment on the
map to view the details and chat directly with the car dealer to finalize shipment details.
